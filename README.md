# Tami

Traditional editors were designed around the workflow of "opening a project and writing code." But now, coding with AI, the actual workflow has changed.

- Jumping between multiple folders to check context
- Copy-pasting AI-generated code
- Running it immediately in the terminal and checking the results

This loop has become the core of how we work.

Project-based editors don't fit this flow. A structure that requires "opening" a single folder to start. A layout where the editor is the center and the terminal is secondary. It was always awkward to freely navigate multiple locations while working terminal-first.

So I built Tami.

## Structure

- **Left**: Folder shortcuts and file explorer
- **Center**: Terminal
- **Right**: A space to attach whatever features you need

No concept of projects. Freely navigate the filesystem. Work directly from the terminal.
